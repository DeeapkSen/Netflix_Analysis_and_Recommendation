# Netflix Analysis and Recommendation

This repository contains a data science project focused on analyzing and recommending strategies for Netflix based on various performance metrics and user engagement data. The project leverages machine learning techniques and advanced data analytics to explore patterns in Netflix data and develop actionable insights for improving subscriber retention and growth.

### Overview
This project aims to understand how various factors, including viewing statistics, user demographics, and market trends, influence Netflix's performance. By analyzing these variables, we seek to uncover insights into the dynamics that shape user engagement and provide strategic recommendations to enhance Netflix's market position and subscriber satisfaction.

### Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigate the dataset to identify patterns, trends, and correlations among different variables.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleanse and preprocess the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables for machine learning models.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance predictive performance.
- **Model Building:** Develop machine learning models, such as regression or classification algorithms, to analyze user behaviour and predict performance outcomes.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the predictive models using appropriate evaluation metrics and techniques.
- **Visualization:** Visualize key insights and model outcomes through charts, graphs, and plots.

### Dataset
The datasets include variables such as viewing statistics, user demographics, and market reports. We explore this data to understand how these factors influence Netflix's performance and user engagement. This dataset is the foundation for our analysis and model-building efforts in providing strategic recommendations.
